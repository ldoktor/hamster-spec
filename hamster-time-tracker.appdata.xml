            Project Hamster is time tracking for individuals. It helps you to keep track on
            how much time you have spent during the day on activities you choose to track.

            Whenever you change from doing one task to other, you change your current
            activity in Hamster. After a while you can see how many hours you have spent on
            what. Maybe print it out, or export to some suitable format, if time reporting
            is a request of your employee.
